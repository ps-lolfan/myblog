to run this app you need basic knowledge of nodejs.

install the packages, run server on port:5000 and client app on any app.

Client app is built with REACT (my fav).
Server app is built with NODEJs.

I built this project with inspiration of facebook, so that people get to know whats up with others.

This is an open platform. 

This is all in one, kinda mixture of stackoverflow and facebook.

Kind enough, got suggestions ??? mail me: pbsinnur@gmail.com
